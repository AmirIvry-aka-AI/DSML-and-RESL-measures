# Objective Metrics to Evaluate Residual-Echo Suppression During Double-Talk - WASPAA Conference 2021
## Amir Ivry, Prof. Israel Cohen, Dr. Baruch Berdugo
> Human subjective evaluation is optimal to assess speech quality for human perception, and the recently introduced deep noise suppression mean opinion score (DNSMOS) metric was shown to estimate human ratings with great accuracy. Still, the signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) metric is widely used to evaluate residual-echo suppression (RES) systems by estimating speech quality during double-talk. However, since the SDR is affected by both speech distortion and residual-echo presence, it does not correlate well with human ratings according to the DNSMOS. <br/> To address that, we introduce two objective metrics to separately quantify the desired-speech maintained level (DSML) and residual-echo suppression level (RESL) during double-talk, and share the code here for reproducability. <br/> You are also encouraged to refer to the more elaborated [github page](https://amirivry-aka-ai.github.io/DSML-and-RESL-measures/) and published paper [Arxiv].
